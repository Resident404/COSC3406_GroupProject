*****PROGRESS REPORT******

Brian, Sana, Randy

We don't have anything except for the provided demos and our assignments.

There will be no screenshots at this time....

Going forward our plan is as follows:

First, set up the engine from demo code ***
  Make some modifications to the SceneGrpah demo code.
    It already has a working implementation of a scene graph for updating and 
    drawing nodes.
    Adjust how transforms are implemented at the SceneNode level for smooth 
    transformation. Change the Camera class to inherit from SceneNode 
    so it may be placed into the scene hierarchy directly.

Second, implement game specific classes (player, enemy, weapons, collectibles)  
Third, implement collision system (ray-sphere, cube-cube, sphere-sphere, etc)

Fourth, movement (player and other objects)
  Get the player controls sorted and add some logic to the games "AI".

Fifth add textures and particle effects to the game.
